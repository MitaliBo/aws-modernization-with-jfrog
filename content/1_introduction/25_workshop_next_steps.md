Before we get started on building, publishing and deploying our NPM application, we must set up our workshop environment. In this setup section, we will:

1. Set up our AWS account and IAM roles.
1. Provision a Cloud9 IDE instance.
1. Prepare our JFrog Platform instance.
1. Install and configure the JFrog CLI.
1. Clone our workshop GitHub repository which contains our code.

In the next section, there will be instructions on how to set everything up, step by step.
