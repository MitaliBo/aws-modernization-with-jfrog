Xray supports all major package types, understands how to unpack them, and uses recursive scanning to see into all of the underlying layers and dependencies of components, even those packaged in Docker images, and zip files.
The comprehensive vulnerability intelligence databases are constantly updated giving the most up-to-date understanding of the security and compliance of your binaries.

The **npm_build** pipeline provided an overview of a typical build, docker build and push, security scan and promotion process using Artifactory, Pipelines and Xray. You were able to execute a pipeline, monitor the progress and examine its results. You explored new steps for NPM.

Next, we will deploy your docker image from the "staging" repository using ECS.
