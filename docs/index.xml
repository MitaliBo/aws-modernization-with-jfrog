      <title>Configure the GitHub Integration</title>
      <link>/70_hands-on_lab/20_configure_github_integration.html</link>

      <description>In order for JFrog Pipelines to get access to the code in your aws-modernization-with-jfrog repository, we must first set up a Pipelines GitHub integration. This allows Pipelines to authenticate and get access to your GitHub repositories. To do this, we create a GitHub Personal Access Token with the correct permissions.
JFrog Pipelines can also integrate with other source code repositories such as GitHub Enterprise, BitBucket and GitLab.
  Go to your GitHub Personal Access Tokens settings page.</description>

      <description>Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) is the process for which your software components are built from code, integrated, tested, released, deployed and ultimately delivered to end-users. CI/CD pipelines are the software assembly line that orchestrates the building of your software. This CI/CD pipeline line requires infrastructure. Cloud computing has allowed this infrastructure to become dynamic and ephemeral. On cloud infrastructure, your CI/CD pipelines scale up and down to meet your software delivery demands.</description>

      <description>A Binary Repository Manager is a software hub that simplifies the development process for different teams across an organization by helping them to collaborate on building coherent and compatible software components. It does this by centralizing the management of all the binary artifacts generated and used by the organization, thereby overcoming the incredible complexity arising from diverse binary artifact types, their position in the overall workflow and the set of dependencies between them.</description>

      <description>Any security issue identified by a security scanning may be reviewed by a small security team that may lack the technical knowledge. This challenge can be reduced by shifting left to the developer and operations teams, making them also responsible for security and compliance. This moves security earlier in the software delivery process. Source code, dependency and artifact security scanning are some examples of moving security into the development process. Implementing the identification of security issues earlier in the CI/CD pipeline, as well as automating security and compliance policies in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), rather than using manual processes, is crucial.</description>

      <title>JFrog Platform for DevOps in the Cloud</title>
      <link>/2_devops_cloud/24_jfrog_platform_overview.html</link>

      <guid>/2_devops_cloud/24_jfrog_platform_overview.html</guid>
      <description>The JFrog Platform is designed to meet the growing needs of companies to develop and distribute software in the cloud. It provides DevOps teams with the tools needed to create, manage, secure and deploy software with ease. These tools cover everything from continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), binary repository management, artifact maturity, security and vulnerability protection (DevSecOps), release management, analytics and distribution.
JFrog Artifactory is an Artifact Repository Manager that fully supports software packages created by any language or technology.</description>

      <title>Configure the Artifactory Integration</title>

      <guid>/70_hands-on_lab/30_configure_artifactory_integration.html</guid>
      <description>Similar to the GitHub Integration, in the following steps you will configure an Artifactory Integration that allows JFrog Pipelines to also access your Artifactory repositories in order to publish your artifacts and build info. You will do this by creating an API key.
Artifactory offers a universal solution supporting all major package formats including Alpine, Maven, Gradle, Docker, Conda, Conan, Debian, Go, Helm, Vagrant, YUM, P2, Ivy, NuGet, PHP, NPM, RubyGems, PyPI, Bower, CocoaPods, GitLFS, Opkg, SBT and more.</description>

      <title>Configure the Initialization Pipeline</title>

      <guid>/70_hands-on_lab/40_configure_initialization_pipeline.html</guid>
      <description>Next, we will update the lab pipelines to add your new GitHub and Artifactory integrations. In previous steps, you forked and cloned the lab repository. We will modify the initialization pipeline in your forked repository to add these integrations.
 In your local git directory, open aws-modernization-with-jfrog/jfrog_pipelines/init-jfrog.yml in your Cloud9 editor. Update the resources section of the file to use your new forked repository. Change the path and substitute your username.</description>

      <title>Configure the Pipeline Source</title>
      <link>/70_hands-on_lab/50_configure_pipeline_source.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/70_hands-on_lab/50_configure_pipeline_source.html</guid>
      <description>In these next steps, we will add the build pipelines as a JFrog Pipelines source. This will allow JFrog Pipelines to execute these pipelines automatically whenever there is a commit or manually as needed.
A Pipeline Source represents a source control repository (such as GitHub or BitBucket) where Pipelines definition files can be found. A pipeline source connects to the repository through an integration.
  In your JFrog Platform instance, go to Pipelines â–º Pipeline Sources.</description>

      <guid>/70_hands-on_lab/60_execute_initialization_pipeline.html</guid>
      <description>The first pipeline that we will execute will initialize our environment. This pipeline will create users, groups, permissions, repositories, Xray policies and watches, Xray indexes and access federation. This prepares our JFrog Platform instance to run our NPM build pipeline.
This pipeline initializes the JFrog Platform for the next build pipelines by creating the necessary users, repositories, permissions and Xray configuration. It does this by using the JFrog Platform REST APIs.</description>

      <title>Execute the NPM Build Pipeline</title>

      <guid>/70_hands-on_lab/70_execute_npm_build_pipeline.html</guid>
      <description>The npm_build pipeline builds our web application. This pipeline uses a NpmBuild Pipelines step build the user interface components. Next, it uses NpmPublish to publish the components. DockerBuild and DockerPush steps are used to build a Docker image and push it to Artifactory. It then scans the build using the XrayScan step. Then it pushes the produced artifacts to the &amp;ldquo;staging&amp;rdquo; repository in Artifactory along with all build information by using the PromoteBuild step.</description>

      <description>In this workshop, we demonstrated that using the JFrog Platform to create CI/CD pipelines to build an application, manage the artifacts, scan the artifacts for security vulnerabilities and license compliance, and publish the artifacts of your application to a staging repository. Then you used Amazon ECS to deploy your application so that end-users can access it. Now you have a basic understanding of the JFrog Platform as a modern DevOps cloud platform on AWS.</description>

      <description>We are now ready to deploy your image with Amazon ECS. If not yet created, Amazon ECS can create a new VPC and ECS cluster as well as the other components that are required to serve your application. Amazon ECS will then authenticate, pull the image from Artifactory and deploy the container to the ECS cluster.
The Amazon ECS first-run wizard guides you through the process of getting started with Amazon ECS using the Fargate launch type.</description>

      <description>In the previous section, we set up JFrog Pipelines to authenticate and publish images to Artifactory. In the next sections, we will add the same Artifactory credentials to AWS Secrets Manager. We will then use an IAM Role to allow Amazon ECS to authenticate with Artifactory, pull the image and deploy it.
Private registry authentication for ECS tasks using AWS Secrets Manager enables you to store your credentials securely and then reference them in your container definition.</description>

      <description>We now have our Artifactory credentials in the AWS Secrets Manager. Next, we must create an IAM role that will allow ECS to access our Artifactory secrets and deploy our image.
Before you can launch ECS container instances and register them into a cluster, you must create an IAM role for those container instances to use when they are launched. The Amazon ECS container agent makes calls to the Amazon ECS API on your behalf using this role.</description>
